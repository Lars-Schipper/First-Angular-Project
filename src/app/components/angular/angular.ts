          This portfolio website is my first project built with Angular. 
          I created it as a way to learn the framework and prepare for my internship, 
          where I’ll be working with Angular more in-depth. 
          Through this project I explored components, routing, 
          and basic structure while building something practical that represents my skills and growth. 
          It’s a starting point, but one that helped me understand the fundamentals and get comfortable with the Angular workflow.
